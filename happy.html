        <p>Dear Dad,</p>
        <p>
          Happy Birthday! ðŸŽ‰ On this special day, I want to take a moment to
          express my deepest gratitude. Thank you for all that you've done for
          me. Your love, guidance, and support have shaped who I am today, and I
          am truly grateful for every moment. You are not just my father but
          also my hero. Your wisdom and strength inspire me every day. May your
          birthday be filled with joy, laughter, and all the things that bring
          you happiness. Here's to celebrating you, Dad!
        </p>
